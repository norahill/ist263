Hi, I'm Nora Hill. I am a Communications major with a double minor in marketing and information management and technology. I am very interested in a career involving content strategy and digital marketing, and am excited to learn more about how websites are deisgned. I participated in the White Denison Speaking Competition, and enjoy public speaking and public advocacy. In my spare time, I enojy reading, and have a goal to read a new book every month. I just finished a book called This Ends with Us, as well as the book called Where the Crawdads Sing. I also love exploring new areas of nature, and recently viisted the Ithaca gorges and hope to go to the farmers market soon! I also enjoy running, spending time with my dog George, and all things travel. I am excited to get started with this class and know it will help me advance my career further.
