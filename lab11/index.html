    Hi, I'm Nora Hill. I am a Communications major with a double minor in marketing and information management and technology. I am very interested in a career involving <strong>content strategy</strong> and <strong>digital marketing,</strong> and am excited to learn more about how websites are deisgned.
    I participated in the White Denison Speaking Competition, and enjoy public speaking and public advocacy. I also have taking multuiple Spanish classes and hope to visit Spain in the near future.
     </p>
     <p style="font-size:2vw;">In my spare time, I enjoy: </p>
     <ol style="font-size:2vw;">
         <li>Reading</li> 
         <li>Working out</li> 
         <li>Finding new restaurants</li> 
         <li>Travel</li> 
        </ol> 
     <p style="font-size:2vw;">A goal to read a new book every month. I just finished a book called This Ends with Us, as well as the book called Where the Crawdads Sing. I also love exploring new areas of nature, and recently viisted the Ithaca gorges and hope to go to the farmers market soon! I also enjoy running, spending time with my dog, George, and all things travel. I am excited to get started with this class and know it will help me advance my career further. </p>
