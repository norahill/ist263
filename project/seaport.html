<h1>Seaport</h1>
<h3>The Seaport District is also known as “New Boston”, since almost everything has been built in the last 10 years, a cool juxtaposition from the historic North End. Here you’ll find new trendy restaurants, a marina, and different pop-up shops and eateries. </h3>

<h3>My Favorite Spots to Eat and Sip</h3>
<ul>
    <li>THE BARKING CRAB:</li> <p>If you’re looking for good New England seafood and a casual spot, this is the restaurant for you. The seafood could not be more fresh, as Barking Crab is propped up right by the seaport, offering up stunning ocean views. Under the red and yellow striped tent, there are open air picnic tables and a wood burning stove inside. Foodies can enjoy delish clambakes, lobster rolls, and crab claws with warm butter. This spot has been a favorite since it opened in 1994, and the vibrant atmosphere and live music keeps people coming back for me. </p></ul>

    <li>LOOKOUT ROOFTOP BAR AND PARA MARIA:<p>This spectacular rooftop bar offers small bites and cocktails, but most importantly, Lookout has views of the harbor-front skylines. I went here for my past birthday, and my friends and I were both blown away from the scenic view. In the winter, guests can reserve heated igloos to keep them warm, while offering up the city skyline. If you make your way downstairs, the chef of Para Maria is a two-time champion on the cooking TV show Chopped, and it shows. From the chipotle portobello tacos to the fresh ceviche, these small plates will be a hit. </p></li>

    <li>LOLITA FORT POINT: <p>If you like Mexican food and waterfront views, you are in for a treat. The interior of Lolita has a gothic style to it with dark shades of red and black and is dimly lit. The walls also have faux stained-glass panels behind the bar, adding to the cool look of the place. While inside is dark and edgy, the outside patio is truly beautiful. Guests can enjoy lobster guacamole, street corn, and sip on their specialty margaritas</p></li>

    <li>CISCO BREWERS’ SEAPORT: <p>Cisco Brewers is a beautiful outdoor beer garden that brings a slice of Nantucket to the bustling city. From frozen wine, ciders, Cisco’s small batch brews, such as Mango Hazy IPA, and multiple food trucks, this is an incredible area for summer nights in Seaport. The laid-back atmosphere has guests seat themselves at picnic benches, and enjoy the scenery, and oftentimes the live music that takes place. </p></li>

<h3>Other Fun Attractions</h3>
<ul>
    <li> INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ARTS:<p>o	This museum, especially for those who enjoy modern and cutting-edge art, is both unique and fascinating. From photography to contemporary paintings, sculptures, and everything in between, this museum with large windows facing the water is a really cool spot to check out. Their exhibits are constantly changing. One noteworthy exhibit was the musical compilation exhibit, which depicted the isolation the country was feeling as we entered the global pandemic. The museum also had a 6-screen video installation called “Purple” about environmental devastation in a watershed. Visitors take a water taxi to the watershed, included in admission, and the exhibits they have here change frequently. </p></li>
    <img src="../project/images/ICA.jpg" alt="ICA"></a> 
    <li>BOSTON TEA PARTY SHIPS AND MUSEUM:<p>o	What differentiates this museum from all the rest, is that Boston Tea Party Ships is a floating museum and gives tours of restored tea ships. Visitors watch a documentary that outlines all the events that took place prior to the American Revolution, in an engaging and high-tech fashion. We have all heard in our high school history classes the quote, “Taxation without representation”, however this museum makes visitors feel the anger and the passion the patriots felt way back when. Understanding the backstory of such a historical city will make your trip that much more magical, especially since the Freedom Trail lines the entire city.
