<h3><strong>The Seaport District is also known as “New Boston”, since almost everything has been built in the last 10 years, a cool juxtaposition from the historic North End. </strong></h3>

        <h2>LOLITA FORT POINT</h2>
        <p>If you like Mexican food and waterfront views, you are in for a treat. The interior of Lolita has a gothic style to it with dark shades of red and black and is dimly lit. The walls also have faux stained-glass panels behind the bar, adding to the cool look of the place. This place is great for <strong>special events, birthdays, and a fun date night!</strong>While inside is dark and edgy, the outside patio is truly beautiful. Guests can enjoy lobster guacamole, street corn, and sip on their specialty margaritas</p>
        <p><strong>PRO TIP:</strong></p>
        <p>If it is summertime, sitting outside is a must. Not only are you by the water, but the atmousphere and stunning candles is delightful. However, if it's a cold winter or fall day, inside really has a vibe that is unique any other restauant I have been to!</p>

        <h2>LOOKOUT ROOFTOP AND PARA MARIA</h2>
        <p>This spectacular rooftop bar offers small bites and cocktails, but most importantly, Lookout has views of the harbor-front skylines. I went here for my past birthday, and my friends and I were both blown away from the scenic view. In the winter, guests can reserve heated igloos to keep them warm, while offering up the city skyline. If you make your way downstairs, the chef of Para Maria is a two-time champion on the cooking TV show Chopped, and it shows. From the chipotle portobello tacos to the fresh ceviche, these small plates will be a hit.</p>
        <p><strong>PRO TIP!</strong><br><br>Especially in the warmer days, Lookout is very booked- Though I have gotten in without a reservation, I highly suggest if you choose to come on a weekend you head online and make a reservation before!</p>

       <h2>BARKING CRAB!</h2>
        <p>If you’re looking for good New England seafood and a casual spot, this is the restaurant for you. The seafood could not be more fresh, as Barking Crab is propped up right by the seaport, offering up stunning ocean views. Under the red and yellow striped tent, there are open air picnic tables and a wood burning stove inside. Foodies can enjoy delish clambakes, lobster rolls, and crab claws with warm butter. This spot has been a favorite since it opened in 1994, and the vibrant atmosphere and live music keeps people coming back for me. </p>
        <p> <strong>PRO TIP:</strong></p>
        <p>Especially in the summers, this place fills up. While you wait for your table I reccomend you head directly across the street to Yotel Deck 12, to sip on a cocktail as you wait. Get there early, because Barking Crab is a place you can stay all night! Enjoy the live music, some oysters, and enjoy the views- this place is extroadinary!</p>

        <h2>INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ARTS:</h2>
        <p>This museum, especially for those who enjoy modern and cutting-edge art, is both unique and fascinating. From photography to contemporary paintings, sculptures, and everything in between, this museum with large windows facing the water is a really cool spot to check out. Their exhibits are constantly changing. One noteworthy exhibit was the musical compilation exhibit, which depicted the isolation the country was feeling as we entered the global pandemic. The museum also had a 6-screen video installation called “Purple” about environmental devastation in a watershed. Visitors take a water taxi to the watershed, included in admission, and the exhibits they have here change frequently.</p>

       <h2>BOSTON TEA PARTY AND MUSEUM</h2>
        <p>What differentiates this museum from all the rest, is that Boston Tea Party Ships is a floating museum and gives tours of restored tea ships. Visitors watch a documentary that outlines all the events that took place prior to the American Revolution, in an engaging and high-tech fashion. We have all heard in our high school history classes the quote, “Taxation without representation”, however this museum makes visitors feel the anger and the passion the patriots felt way back when. Understanding the backstory of such a historical city will make your trip that much more magical, especially since the Freedom Trail lines the entire city.</p>
