    <h1>The North End</h1>
    <h3>Living in the North End this past summer was nothing short of a dream. <br>Close your eyes and envision cannoli shops on the street, the smell of garlic in the air, as you walk past shops making home-made pasta. <br> <br>If Italy does not fit the budget but you, North End is the place to spend out your summer days. Because so much of the North End is centered around the delicious Italian food, I’ll give you the best spots, after having tried a good handful of the restaurants. </h3>
    <h3>Let's Talk Pasta:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>BACCO
            <p>This authentic Italian restaurant will leave you speechless and is my all-time favorite restaurant to go to. A glass of Chianti from Central Tuscany, along with their roasted eggplant pasta in the spicy marinara sauce, topped heavily with mozzarella cheese, will be a hit for the table. Don’t forget to order the homemade meatballs and top off the dinner with their girl scout cookie espresso martini. Trust me on this recommendation, and you will be happy you did. </p>

        </li>
        <li>BRICCO <p> Though pricier than Bacco, this famous North End restaurant is a must. From the darkly lit atmosphere to the warm homemade bread and olive oil that is served immediately when you sit down, you will be impressed. Attached to Bricco is a little bakery called Bricco Salumeria & Pasta Shop, where fresh bread and artisanal pasta is made daily, which is directly used in the restaurant. From ciabatta bread, fresh baguettes, and sunflower bread, getting a loaf to-go is the way to go. </p></li>

    </ul>  
    <h3>Now that we've eaten, what's for desert?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>MIKE'S PASTRY <p>Located on Hanover Street, there was never a night this past summer that I went and didn’t see a line wrapping around the street. This pastry shop is always crowded and bustling because of how famous it is for their cannoli’s. In fact, going to Mike’s Pastry has become a Boston tradition, and tourists are always eager to try their one-of-a-kind cannoli’s that keeps the people coming back for me. After trying five different cannoli throughout the North End, I can confidently say the pastries and sweets at Mike’s come in first place. The flavors of cannoli and variations of ricotta cheese are endless, from pistachio, caramel, and even mint chocolate chip. The handmade cannoli shells are the perfect crunch making it the best in the North End, especially because they are the only shop in the North End who makes their shells in house. </p></li>

        <li>BOVA's <p>Not only is Bova’s bakery voted for having the #1 tiramisu in the country, but this authentic Italian bakery is open 24/7! People flock from all over the country for this special tiramisu, which is filled with espresso and rum, and then filled with vanilla soaked sponge layers. You can find people here late at night getting their homemade calzones and arancini, also known as rice balls that are stuffed with cheese and meat like meatballs or steak Their Sicilian cannoli’s are also award winning, and their shells are deep fried to give the cannoli a crisp and bubbly shell. They also heavily sell lobster tail pastries, which is creamed puff dough filled with ricotta cheese. </p></li>

    <h3>Other attractions to check out:</h3>
        <li>PAUL REVERE'S HOUSE: 
            <p>For all the history buffs, this house dates to 1960 and has a museum attached to it. You’ll see the 2.5-mile-long Freedom Trail from here, as well as in other parts of the city, that connects 16 nationally significant historic sites. </p>

        </li>
        <li>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS PARK:
            <p>The beautiful waterfront park has a flower garden, great restaurants next to it, and is right next to the Aquarium! The seals in the Aquarium are always out-front in the tank, and always a serotonin boost to see them playing in the water. </p>

        <li>FANIEL HALL 
            <img src="../project/images/fanielhall.jpeg" alt="Faniel Hall">
            <p> Faneuil Hall is a ten-minute walk from Hanover Street and is worth it to check out. There is shopping inside Faneuil Hall, and every food imaginable is inside. Boston Chowda always has samples of their famous clam chowder for tastings, while at Wicked Lobsta, you can treat yourself to a fresh lobster roll in a buttery roll. There are always street performers outside the doors of Faneuil Hall and can always count on it being entertaining. </p>
