    <h2> A Local's Guide to Boston</h2>
    <div id="about">
    <p>Hi, I'm Nora, and I am a proud Bostonian. <br> <br>
        This past summer, I found myself staying in a little apartment in the North End, in the heart of the vibrant city, and directly on Hanover Street next to all the action. Let's just say I took full advantage of my surroundings, and I'm ready to share and spread the love!
        <br><br> From the crisp leaves that line the cobblestone streets in the Fall, to the cool air coming into the seaport, Boston is different and equally wonderful in every season. Can you tell I like to romanticize my life? Hailing from Boston, Massachusetts, and having had countless visitors stay with me from college, I quickly learned the value of a locals guide to offer up the unique hidden gems in this special city. While websites like Tripadvisor can offer up incredible ideas and restaurants no matter what season you visit, there is nothing quite like a localâ€™s guide. Not only is Boston rich in seasonings but is it rich in history ready for you to explore. Whether you're from New England and are seeking new ideas for day trips, or are hoping to visit, my goal is to give you recommendations that will unlock your wanderlust, while leaving your stomach hungry. </p>
